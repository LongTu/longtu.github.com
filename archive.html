<H5>Distributed Machine Learning Applications</H5>
<p>
From 2014 to 2015, I was working on predicting user segments including gender and age information on Hadoop. I use Vowpal Wabbit as machine learning toolkit.
</p>

<H5>SSL/TLS</H5>
<p>
During the summer of 2013, I built a Certificate Discovery Tool that is able to connect SSL/TLS/starttls (XMPP&Ldap) servers and obtain X.509 Certificate information. <br \>
This software hacked the SSL/TLS three-way handshake in the middle by sending fake handshake requests. It helped automatize the verification process of back-end teams and eliminated the unexpected certificate expiration issue for all internal servers.
</p>
<H5>Content Mining</H5>
<p>
I was working on Rost Content Mining System, at Internet Science Research Center of Wuhan University from 2010 to 2011. Here is a

Most of my work was to add new features for ROST CM6, including clustering, web mining, etc.

<H5>ACM-ICPC</H5>
<p>
I joined ACM-ICPC programming team at 2008, Wuhan University, during which we solve algorithm/engineering problems in a team of three. I also won a third prize during the 2009 ACM-ICPC competition, North Central District of China
